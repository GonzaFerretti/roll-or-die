(Development period: less than 48hs - July 2022)

In Roll Or Die you play as Rollando, the six-sided die. Survive hordes of Savage D20s and Evil D8s, rolling both out of harm's way AND over powerful arcane weapons.
Aim with your mouse, move with WASD and press space to dodge AND change your weapons. Try the original jam version in https://bittermossgames.itch.io/roll-or-die.
